    title: Mobile Bioskills Labs
    description: Our mobile bioskills labs are deployable to any location in the
      US.  This improves cost-efficiency and negates logistical constraints for
      obtaining the best hands-on emergency medical training possible.  Our
      refrigerated transports hold up to 8 cadavers that are preserved through a
      proprietary preservation method that maintains lifelike tissue consistency
      and color.  Expert instructors are available upon request.

    title: AR/VR Immersive Instruction
    description: Instructors and students engage in a shared Augmented Reality
      training classroom.  This enhances instruction and knowledge retention
      through detailed anatomical holograms and other multi-media teaching
      resources.  Dynamic branching scenarios with realistic mechanisms of
      injury and environmental stressors challenge students' decision making and
      level of skill.

    title: Human Performance Metrics
    description: We are developing a machine learning system to help standardize and
      quantify both student skill mastery and instructor proficiency.  The
      system will intake biometric, volumetric, and motion capture data to first
      establish benchmarks of expert level performance.  Then students can be
      evaluated against these benchmarks for near real-time feedback and
      corrective action.

    title: Dynamic Scenario Authoring
    description: To power the VR/AR shared classroom experience, we built a Scenario
      Authoring System (SAS).  The SAS enables instructors to build complex
      branching scenarios complete with complications.  For practical
      assessment, students can be dropped in any number of scenarios and the
      system will respond dynamically to their decision making and skill.  Our
      intent is for the SAS to be its own ecosystem that enables rapid knowledge
      sharing across diverse teams.
